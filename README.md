# Development Environment Setup

Instructions to Setup Development Environments for various Programming Languages (C, C++, Python, NodeJS, etc.) on Windows 10, Mac and Linux

## Instruction Notes

- **\$** is default prompt for regular user and is always there on Mac and Ubuntu Bash Terminal
  - you don't type it as a part of command
- **#** on bash command is comment ignored by the Bash Terminal
  - you don't need to type it as a part of command
- any command that starts with **sudo** keyword requires admin priviledge and prompts for your password
- **\< ... \>** - is a place holder that must be completely replaced (including the angular brackets) with actual content in place

## Windows 10

If you're running Windows 10, follow the instructions in this section. Windows instructions use WSL Ubuntu Bash Terminal to install Linux-based tool chains.

NOTE: Certain tool chains may not work with WSL. So, it's highly recommended that you first install Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine (VM) and follow the instruction for Linux development environment setup. In order to run VM smoothly, your system must have atleast 8 GB RAM and 4 cores so you can allocate 4GB RAM and 2 cores to your VM. You can format and install Ubuntu Linux as the host Operating System if your system doesn't have aequate resources.
